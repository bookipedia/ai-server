The resulting text is exported as an XML file and converted into a PDF with HOCR annotations for easy text retrieval. |
| [document.py](preprocessing/document.py)       | Document processing orchestrates the transformation of raw documents into structured data. It leverages OCR for text-based documents, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a database for efficient retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
